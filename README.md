# Google Map Javascript Api integration
integration example of Maps JavaScript API and google Places API

The idea of this code is to obtain the coordinates of an address and be able to save them to consult the map later without having to permanently consult google due to the new rates of use of maps.

The maps javascript api is used to show the map and the places api to consult the address by name.
